Introduction

This bot/page is still getting edited and this was made in just a day, there will be tons of updates and there will be a new profile system and log in system for Discord Bot Helpers and the bot, hopefully!

HelpBoat is a very useful and a Helpful Bot to server owners. It can do all sorts of functions and can help you moderate and use powers on users that are being very disrespectful or not following the directions that you've given.

Please do not invite HelpBoat to any bot collection server, as the owner of me doesn't like the poor servers, because he likes to keep track of the actual servers.

If you didn't know a bot collection server is a server that has mutiple bots and doesn't use them they just like to have tons of bots in there server so they don't have a lot of real actual people, and they don't let them have any permissions. They just use them to get 100 people (bots) and then they try to make there "offline" bar to go away. Then actually having real humans join, which is easy to do.

The bot was officially made on discord.js and maintaned a ton and has gotten many new features and is still gaining and gaining new features every week/weekend to the max. HelpBoat can mostly do everything you want it to. If you are wishing to either make a suggestion just either shoot the owner a direct message or a issue statement. We'll check it out as soon as possible.

We have a ton of moderators and administrators that keep everyone busy and keep people motivated to make a bot at Discord Bot Helpers, we encourage everyone in the discord community to just try and try to make a bot. And if they try and they cant that's always fine. Atleast if it can do a simple command like replying back to someone/something. We also have some and mutiple beta testers that help and keep the bot maintenanced and good and that make it healthy for others to use.

Beta Tester: Applications

The current status of the beta tester applications are currently closed. Due to we have a huge amount of beta testers and that the application test hasn't even came out that will be later.

Uptime

The uptime for the bot is usually on 24/7 or another word is online all the time and is at your service. The bot is currently on a VPS that is secure and that no backdoors for any hacker or anybody can get in through. The bot has a command named ?uptime to check the current stats of the bot

Website

The current website it's currently linked up to is a work in progress website. That website will include profiles and a login system for the bot so, moderators, beta testers and up can access huge features to the bot.

If you have any questions or concerns, please be willing to ask a moderator or a worker for HelpBoat.

Setup Guide

The setup guide for HelpBoat is currently undermaintenance, we'll post it later.
